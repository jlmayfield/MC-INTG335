We won't be able to discuss the film \textit{Robot and Frank} until we return, so to be sure you have something to jog your memory when you return, you're going to fill out this worksheet as you watch the film. We're looking for observations that cut across all three of the major topics we've covered in this course thus far.

\begin{itemize}
\item AI and our Intellect:  How AI make us re-evaluate the ways in which we use our intellect.
\item AI in control: What happens when we let the machines do things for us and what that says about our priorities.
\item Relationships with AI: How we interact project and engage with AI 
\end{itemize}


Observations should deal with specific characters and specific encounters. If you start to see themes emerging, then make note of them only after you've seen several scenes that draw upon the larger theme. We'll ferret out the big picture later.  For now you need to look at moment to moment details.
