\section{Prompt}

For your final paper you will use Philip K Dick's novel\citep{dick_androids_2008} and James F. McGrath's article\citep{mcgrath_religion_2011} as guides into the quagmire that is consciousness and strong AI\@. Both Dick and McGrath warn of the difficulty of objectively determining if an AI is a strong AI or simply a weak AI doing an very convincing simulation of general intelligence and consciousness. With the boundary being so blurry, how are we to proceed? Should we more concerned about creating a weak AI that is too convincing or a strong AI that we do not accept as such? What would the existence of a provably strong AI mean for you personal?

\section{The Writing Center}

Wonderful ideas and deep reflection can be lost or ruined by muddled writing.  I grew most as a writer when I cared deeply about the things I was writing and didn't want there to be any uncertainty on the part of my readers. Perhaps more than other forms or writing, reflective writing is ultimately a reflection of ourselves. You should want to put your best word forward when it's you on the page. Writing well is hard. It takes practice. I requires help. I encourage \textit{all} of you to take this opportunity to step up your writing game. The writing center is here to help you. They're awesome. Don't wait until my grade to get feedback on the quality and clarity of your writing.
