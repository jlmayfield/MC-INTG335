This journal has two parts: find a piece of art in the area assigned to your group and in which an AI played a major role, and then reflect on the aesthetics of that art. Make efforts to find a piece of art that really challenges you in some way rather than going with the first thing you find. Then consider one or more of the following question in your reflection. What is your reaction to the art? In what way does it speak to you? What role, if any, does the fact that a machine took part in its creation play in your appreciation of the art?  Be prepared to share the art with the class on Wednesday.
