This journal is all about collecting observations and perhaps just a little bit of analysis. Don't write a full reflection. Don't offer up conclusions.

\section{The Assignment}

We've encountered the story of two noteworth AI\@: Deep Blue and Chinook. Look through these stories and the ways in which people interacted with these AI\@. Find moments that speak towards someone's values and what they find important in their lives and life generally. Compare and contrast how players react to the AI, how bystanders react, and how the scientists developing the AI react. Look for similarities and differences across the two stories. Finally, identify moments that stick out to you personally. Use no more than a half of a page or so for observations.

Once you've delved into the details of these stories and observed key moments. Pick one ore two observations that you find most compelling and analyze them. Explore how your experiences and values color your reactions to what you observed and how it may differ from those involved in the stories. Did encountering the AI affect you in the similar or different ways than those who encountered the AI originally? Have you experienced something similar to what you observed? Write just a paragraph or two of analysis.
