For this journal entry I want you to do a quick, focused reflection. We've spent the week listening to podcasts about the impact of AI-based automation on jobs.  In class Wednesday you discussed the ideas presented in ``Re-Educating Rita'' and possible ways to address the rise of automation.  Now turn the attention back to you, your education, and your future. Do you look at your education and future career differently and if so, how and why? If not, what about your current path makes it future proof\sidenote{Do not argue that your intended job cannot be automated. Assume that it can.}
