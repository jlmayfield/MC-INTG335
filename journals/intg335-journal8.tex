We've looked at two ways that AI can be used to mimic a human being. In once case, Eugenia Kuyda built an AI that let her continue to text message her now deceased friend Roman Mazurenko.  In the other story we learned that similar AI can be used to produce fake audio and video footage of someone. For this journal I want you \textit{weigh the bad and good of this technology and consider the extent to which your evaluation is influenced by a rational calculation or a more emotional judgement.}  Your goal is to find and identify the different ``voices''\sidenote{a la the Trolley Problem Pod Cast} that arise when you consider the possibility of an AI doppelganger.  Don't worry about coming to any kind of conclusion, simply work to listen more attentively to your own inner monologue.
