\section{The Assignment}

A good conclusion will make or break a reflection paper in much the same way that a good thesis does an argumentative essay. Your primary goal for this journal is to offer up a few possible conclusions. Then for the one you're feeling best  about, list the key observations and points of analysis that led you to the conclusion.
