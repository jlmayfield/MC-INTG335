\section{Prompt}

The AI we explored prior to this section of the course have primarily appealed to a more pragmatic part us. They play games better, the do jobs better, and generally optimize some task that we want done along some metric that has clear benefit. In this third section of the course we've begun looking at AI that provide for needs and desires of a more emotional nature or that simply invoke some kind of emotional response from us.

% Refine
Should we be concerned about the mechanization and automation of our emotional selves? Is it OK to have a relationship, of any kind, with a weak AI\@?

\section{The Writing Center}

Wonderful ideas and deep reflection can be lost or ruined by muddled writing.  I grew most as a writer when I cared deeply about the things I was writing and didn't want there to be any uncertainty on the part of my readers. Perhaps more than other forms or writing, reflective writing is ultimately a reflection of ourselves. You should want to put your best word forward when it's you on the page. Writing well is hard. It takes practice. I requires help. I encourage \textit{all} of you to take this opportunity to step up your writing game. The writing center is here to help you. They're awesome. Don't wait until my grade to get feedback on the quality and clarity of your writing.
